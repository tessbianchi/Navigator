[X] YAML file for the missions
[X] Constants in the Perception object
[X] Using new service in Navigator singleton
[X] Async Queue
[X] Adding get element to the navigator object


Tests:


- Test safe_exit is called after mission fails
- test that mission stops after no more object dep is found
- test that base mission stops when a new object is found
- test that all missions run if everything is found
- 

to do

- move all the missions to the other file
- create test package 
- add mission planner exit
